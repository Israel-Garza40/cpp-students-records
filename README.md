# cpp-students-records
Create a C++ file called student_records.cpp.
   
Implement the following functionalities:
1)Use an enum to define grade levels (FRESHMAN, SOPHOMORE, JUNIOR, SENIOR).
2)Use typedef or using to simplify data type definitions.
3)Store student names using the string class and perform string operations.
4)Use a custom namespace to group student-related functions.
5)Allow the user to enter multiple student records and store them dynamically.
6)Add sorting functionality to display students in alphabetical order.
7)Implement basic GPA validation (e.g., must be between 0.00 and 4.00).
